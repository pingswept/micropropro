## Arduino challenges

1. Make your Arduino run the "Blink" example.
2. Make your Arduino flash an LED so there are 2 flashes per second, controlled by pin D5.
3. Make your Arduino send the text, "I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords." to your serial monitor once per second.
4. Use a 10k resistor to pull pin D5 high or low. Print out the pin's state as "HIGH" or "LOW" on the serial monitor every time it changes.
5. Make an LED on D7 mirror the state of D5, controlled by the 10k resistor as in the previous challenge.
6. Make an LED attached to pin D7 send Morse code for "TUFTS".
7. Turn your gearmotor on for 5 seconds, then off for 5 seconds, then repeat, using pin D4. You'll probably need a transistor for this.
8. Make your gearmotor slowly increase in speed for 5 seconds, then slowly decrease in speed for 5 seconds, then repeat, using pin D4.
9. Use your potentiometer to make a variable voltage. Read the voltage with pin A0, then print the voltage (in volts) to the serial monitor.
10. Use you potentiometer on pin A0 to control the speed of your gearmotor on pin D4.
