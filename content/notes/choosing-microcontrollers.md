## Choosing a microcontroller ##

First off, there are two ways to buy a microcontroller. If you work at a large company, or at an engineering consulting firm, you can call any of the large microcontroller manufacturers, and they will be happy to send a salesperson to your office. They will give you free chips for testing and help you understand the different chips they sell. They do this because they expect that you will place an order of at least 100,000 chips.

If you are not in the situation where you can convince someone that you might place an order for 100,000 chips, you will need to get a chip from a distributor, like Digikey, Mouser, or Newark. They sell chips from 10 major players.

## The major players ##

* Microchip: PIC12, 16, 18, and 24
* Atmel (owned by Microchip since 2016)
* NXP
* Analog Devices
* Silicon Labs
* Freescale (formerly Motorola, owned by NXP since 2015)
* Infineon
* Cypress
* ST: STM32 ARM Cortex series
* Renesas
* Texas Instruments

There are two other manufacturers to keep in mind: Espressif and Nordic Semiconductor.

Espressif makes the ESP8266 and ESP32 series, which are frightenly cheap and popular among hobbyists.

Nordic makes the nRF52 series of Cortex M4 microcontrollers, which have embedded Bluetooth modules. They're probably the cheapest way to mess around with Bluetooth Digikey sells their demo board as 1490-1073-ND for $10.00.
