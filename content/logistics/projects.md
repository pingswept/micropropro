## P1: Design and build a new RPi hat (due at 10:30 AM, Feb. 11)

Design a small PCB that can plug into the top a Raspberry Pi 4 or Zero (a "hat") that enhances its capabilities in a new way.

It's okay if someone else has made a sort of similar hat, but yours should be a new design. For example, there are hats that drive motors, but none that use the TB6600 driver chip. There are new sensors and other chips coming out every day. Ask your non-engineer friends what magical device they wish they had; build the closest approximation you can.

Let's be clear about what the goals are here. If you have never made a PCB before, your goal should be to submit a PCB before the due date where at least the components you think you need can be soldered to the board-- think of it as a first draft. If you have made several PCBs before, you should aim to make something that actually works, though it's hard to get every detail right on the first try.

A few detailed requirements:

* Please use [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org) to design the PCB.
* For fabrication, please use [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com). They're reasonably cheap and have successfully delivered over 100 PCB orders to Tufts with zero mistakes.
* Your PCB should almost certainly use a [2x20, 0.100" pitch header socket](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2243). I will order a pile of them, so we can get them more cheaply ($0.50 each direct from China via Ebay, instead of more like $2.00, with shipping amortized across 35 people).
