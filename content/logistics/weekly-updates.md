> ME 30 Weekly Update Email for Friday, 10/16/20
>
>**Things due in Week 7:**
> * [Video Response 6](https://flipgrid.com/me30) by Monday 11:59pm, on Flipgrid (please post within the prompt for your pod)
> * [Project 3 prototype](https://canvas.tufts.edu/courses/22096/assignments/107781) by Wednesday 11:59pm, on Canvas
>
>**Learning goals for Week 7:**
> * Gain familiarity with incorporating microcontroller hardware peripherals into circuit designs, including the i2C module, PWM module, and serial port module.
> * Gain enough familiarity with C programming to code an electromechanical game controlled by an Arduino.
>
>**What you should watch and read before Week 7 pods in ME 30:**
> * [Arduino programming](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/arduino-programming/)    
> * [Analog vs digital](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/analog/)
> * [I2C](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/i2c/) (includes a mini-lecture video)
> * [Project 3 Description](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/projects/#project-3-build-an-electromechanical-game): Your task is to build a game with the following characteristics:  
>   - It is controlled by a microcontroller like an Arduino or Raspberry Pi. (Choose the Arduino unless you’re a Pi zealot.)
>   - It has at least one electromechanical element that moves, like a motor or a solenoid.
>   - It has some kind of user input, like buttons, knobs, joysticks, sensors, or the like.
>   - It is at least sort of fun to play. A blinking LED is not a game.
>   - (It does not need to have a custom PCB, but it can if you want. If it has a custom PCB, you must make a working prototype first.)
>
>**Optional textbook reading for Week 7:**
> * Note that both of our optional course textbooks are available online for free from Tisch Library
> * “Section 13.5: Interfacing with microcontrollers” (pgs. 874-892) in [Practical Electronics for Inventors](https://tufts-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/k87dab/TN_cdi_safari_books_9781259587559) (Scherz & Monk)

## September 25, 2020

> ME 30 Expectations for Week 4 (Weekly Update Email for Friday, 9/25/20)
> 
> **Some notes about our course structure:**  
> If you have the feeling in pods like, “Hey, they’re not really explaining this stuff to us. It’s like they’re assuming that we’ve heard this stuff before somewhere else,” you probably need to review how this unusual course is run:  
> * Please be sure that you are reading the weekly update emails and that you are studying the web page notes and videos listed in that email. The weekly emails are archived on the website if you’ve missed a couple weeks.
> * ME 30 follows a sort of flipped classroom model, and it requires your viewing of the videos and notes so that we can devote pod time to circuit building, troubleshooting, and discussion.  
> * The web page notes and videos are the “lecture” portion of ME 30. Because we’re only asking for 70 minutes of your time in pods each week, we’re expecting you will find at least that amount of time outside of pods to watch the videos and study the related notes. We’re designing the pod activities as learning experiences that build on the notes, videos, and Flipgrid Video Response exercises.  
> 
> **Things due in Week 4:**  
> * [Video Response 4](flipgrid.com/me30) by Monday 1:00pm, on Flipgrid (please post within the prompt for your pod)  
> * [Project 2 Prototype](https://canvas.tufts.edu/courses/22096/assignments/107779) by Wednesday 11:59pm  
> 
> **Learning goals for Week 4:**  
> * Explain how to use transistors to control high power with low power.  
> * Begin to compare different types of motors (DC, stepper, and servo) and build circuits incorporating motors.  
> * Explain how an H-bridge motor controller works.  
> 
> **What you should watch and read before Week 4 pods:**
> * [Low power/high power](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/low-power-high-power/) (includes three mini-lecture videos)
> * [H-bridges](http://andnowforelectronics.com/notes/h-bridge/)
> * [Project 2 introduction](http://andnowforelectronics.com/logistics/projects/) (includes one mini-lecture video)  
>
> If you’re feeling iffy about breadboarding, make sure you’ve reviewed the website notes  and videos on:  
> * Prototyping  
> * Voltage and current  
> * Resistors  
> * Series vs. parallel  
>
> For Week 4, an optional resources is the “Transistors” section of Scherz & Monk textbook (if you have it) (section 4.3, pgs. 429-467)
>

## September 2, 2020

> Greetings, ME 30!
> 
> Please check out this video about how we’ve been getting ready:
> https://mediaspace.tufts.edu/media/t/1_rlmn097b 
> 
> And, here are answers to some of the questions you might have about how the course is going to work.
> 
> **How and when is class happening?**
> 
> The “live” portion of our class will take place during our scheduled Tues/Thurs class time, over Zoom, in four small groups that we are calling pods.
Following this email, you’ll receive an email indicating your ME 30 “pod” assignment (North, South, East, or West). Please make a note of your pod. It’s important. Each pod includes 16 or 17 students and will meet up over Zoom with one instructor and one LA for half of our scheduled class time.  
> You can find the Zoom meeting link for your pod on the ME 30 Canvas site.   
> North and South pods meet Tues/Thurs 1:30 to 2:05.  
> East and West pods meet Tues/Thurs 2:10 to 2:45.  
> Looking forward to seeing you on Tuesday, Sep. 8, at 1:30 (North and South pods) or 2:05 (East and West pods)!  
>  
> 
> **Why is the course Canvas site so sparse?**
> 
> Because we have a course website!  It’s http://andnowforelectronics.com  
> We’ll just use Canvas as a way to accept and keep track of your assignments, and to organize Zoom meeting links.
>  
> 
> **If we are meeting by Zoom, then why is this class listed as “hybrid”?**
> 
> We have reserved classrooms for you to use during your pod time if you’d like to be physically present with classmates. These classrooms are sized for 17 of you at a time, with physical distancing. Going to a classroom is totally optional! The instructors and LAs will NOT be present in the classrooms. Your pod assignment email will provide location information. Please, please, please do not go to the other pod’s classroom or stay in your classroom past your assigned time. That will bring the rooms over safe capacity. And, it will be confusing because you’ll be in a room with a bunch of people on a different Zoom call.
> 
>  
> **Is there anything students should do before the first day of class, Sep. 8?**
> 
> Yes! Here’s what we’d like you to do, if you can:
> 
> (1) **Go to our course website and carefully read the Syllabus and Course Norms sections under “Logistics.”** The syllabus is somewhat lengthy, so please give yourself some time to digest it. Please contact us if you have questions.  
> 
> (2) Join our course Slack workspace by responding to the invitation email we send you. Try saying hello to everyone.  
> 
> (3) **If you’re on campus or in town and able to leave your room, pick up your project kit from the table outside of Nolop on Sep. 6, 7, or 8, ideally before 1:30pm on Sep. 8.**  
> 
> (4) If you’re on campus, decide whether you will stay home or go to the reserved classroom during your Sep. 8 pod session. Remember, if you choose to go to the classroom, you need a mask and you need to stay 6 feet apart from each other.  
> 
> (5) **If you’re going to be on campus but aren’t moving in until Sep. 8 or afterwards, don’t worry! Just send us a note on Slack or email when you arrive, and we’ll get you a kit.** Please come join the Sep. 8 and Sep. 10 pod sessions anyway. We know it is not your fault if you can’t pick up your kit earlier!  
> 
> (6) If you’re remote for the whole semester, look out for your project kit being delivered to the address you provided us.  
> 
> (7) Once you have your project kit, plan to have it with you during every pod session.  
> 
> Best,
> Brandon Stafford and Kristen Wendell


## June 26, 2020

> Hello,
> 
> This email is from Brandon Stafford and Kristen Wendell. We're co-teaching ME 30 this fall, and you're enrolled in the class. Welcome! You're going to love it.
> 
> On SIS, ME30 is described as "Hybrid: In Person/Remote." That's a little vague, so we wanted to give a little more explanation.
> 
> The plan is that ME30 will be a virtual/hybrid model, with no required synchronous activities but opportunities for (a) real-time interaction with the instructors during scheduled class times and (b) in-person gathering with other students for those who wish. There are 9 pillars to the course:
> 
> * we mail/give you a project kit and plan for PCB fabrication and assembly
> * collection of pre-existing resources: a textbook plus other stuff on the website
> * short, topical videos, incrementally released, specific to our class
> * central website for syllabus, links to everything else
> * some kind of chat, probably Slack
> * Zoom “pod” sessions held during scheduled class time -- pods are small groups of 16 students, each pod will do real-time Q&A with one instructor for half of each class session; students may choose to join remotely or to gather physically in our reserved classroom while participating, but instructors will run the pod sessions remotely
> * community enrichment activities, like streaming electronics teardowns
> * email status updates weekly, crossposted to website and chat
> * some form of assessment
> 
> But just to be clear, this is all just a plan that we have been emailing back and forth about. The textbook is selected, the first 5 kits are ordered, and the first video has been recorded, but the editing has only just begun.
> 
> At the bottom of the message, you can see the pile of stuff we're getting ready for you. The kits will include two different microcontrollers-- an Arduino MKR 1010 Wifi and the new Raspberry Pi 4, plus all the stuff you'll need for prototyping electronic systems, controlling motors, and hooking up sensors. During the semester, you're also going to be getting printed circuit boards that you design professionally fabricated, probably in China.
> 
> We also have 3 awesome LA's for the course: Jared Jaramillo, Libby Albanese, and Jeremy Kanovsky. They have all either taken my electronics course previously or are the co-president of Tufts Robotics, or both.
> 
> If you have questions about the course, we're happy to answer them. My guess is that we'll get a lot of questions, so we'll collect them via email until Monday, and then send you all the answers at once. (If you have a question you'd rather have answered privately, or no questions at all, that's okay too.)
> 
> With great excitement,
> Brandon Stafford and Kristen Wendell
