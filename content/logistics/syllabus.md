# Microcontroller Programming Projects

ME 194, Microcontroller Programming Projects, Section MPP, class number xxxxx

# DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT

## This is a new course, so we are attaching the wings to the plane as the plane is accelerating down the runway.

If you see weird references to ME 30, that's because this website is based off the ME 30 website, and I'm still revising it.

## Course description

Project-based investigation of embedded systems programming in C and assembly. Distributed version control. Building firmware, bootloaders, and watchdogs. Microcontroller hardware peripherals, with emphasis on the Arduino and Raspberry Pi families. TCP/IP, ARP, 802.1x protocols and packet sniffing. Independent final project of student’s choosing.

## Course goals

Learn some stuff! (more details soon)

### Key topics (more details soon)
•	Arduino hardware
•	Arduino programming
•	Microcontroller peripherals: PWM module, serial port module, i2c module
•	Frequency domain and digital filter basics
•	IoT basics
•	Raspberry Pi hardware
•	Raspberry Pi programming
•	Ethics in electronics and robotics
•	Professional responsibilities and decision-making; career trajectories

Other topics we may or may not cover:

1. git, Github
2. Linux, shell scripting
3. something like Puppet, Chef, or Ansible
4. maybe VMs/Docker?
5. security: passwords, hashes, buffer overflows, fuzzing
6. automated testing, continuous integration, verification, validation
7. functional programming, idempotency, reproducible builds
8. assembly
9. machine code, compilation, instruction sets, computer architecture
10. linking, loading, memory maps
11. open source licenses, copyright, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets
12. compilers vs. interpreters
13. SSH tunnels
14. state machines
15. reverse engineering binary blobs

## Honesty

We take honesty very seriously. Not only are we required to report violations of academic integrity, we are glad to do so. We are all fortunate to be at Tufts; there is no excuse for squandering that opportunity by representing someone else's work as your own. If you're unsure about the details, read the [Tufts Academic Integrity Policy](https://students.tufts.edu/student-affairs/student-life-policies/academic-integrity-policy).


## Accommodations for students with disabilities

Tufts is committed to providing equal access and support to all qualified students through reasonable accommodations so that each student may fully participate in the Tufts experience. If you have a disability that requires accommodations, please email accessibility@tufts.edu or call 617-627-4539 to make an appointment to talk with a Student Accessibility Services representative about appropriate accommodations.

Please be aware that accommodations cannot be enacted retroactively.
