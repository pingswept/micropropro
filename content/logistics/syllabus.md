# DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT

## This is a new course, so we are attaching the wings to the plane as the plane is accelerating down the runway.

If you see weird references to ME 30, that's because this website is based off the ME 30 website, and I'm still revising it.

## Course description

Project-based investigation of embedded systems programming in C and assembly. Distributed version control. Building firmware, bootloaders, and watchdogs. Microcontroller hardware peripherals, with emphasis on the Arduino and Raspberry Pi families. TCP/IP, ARP, 802.1x protocols and packet sniffing. Independent final project of student’s choosing.

## Course goals

### Key topics (more details soon)
•	Arduino hardware
•	Arduino programming
•	Microcontroller peripherals: PWM module, serial port module, i2c module
•	Frequency domain and digital filter basics
•	IoT basics
•	Raspberry Pi hardware
•	Raspberry Pi programming
•	Ethics in electronics and robotics
•	Professional responsibilities and decision-making; career trajectories

Other topics we may or may not cover:

1. git, Github (we're doing this)
2. Linux, shell scripting
3. something like Puppet, Chef, or Ansible
4. maybe VMs/Docker?
5. security: passwords, hashes, buffer overflows, fuzzing
6. automated testing, continuous integration, verification, validation
7. functional programming, idempotency, reproducible builds
8. assembly
9. machine code, compilation, instruction sets, computer architecture
10. linking, loading, memory maps
11. open source licenses, copyright, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets
12. compilers vs. interpreters
13. SSH tunnels
14. state machines
15. reverse engineering binary blobs

## Honesty

I take honesty very seriously. Not only am I required to report violations of academic integrity, I am glad to do so. We are all fortunate to be at Tufts; there is no excuse for squandering that opportunity by representing someone else's work as your own. If you're unsure about the details, read the [Tufts Academic Integrity Policy](https://students.tufts.edu/student-affairs/student-life-policies/academic-integrity-policy).


## Accommodations for students with disabilities

Tufts is committed to providing equal access and support to all qualified students through reasonable accommodations so that each student may fully participate in the Tufts experience. If you have a disability that requires accommodations, please email accessibility@tufts.edu or call 617-627-4539 to make an appointment to talk with a Student Accessibility Services representative about appropriate accommodations. Accommodations cannot be enacted retroactively.

## Financial hardship

Because this course is project-based, there will be some expenses for materials. You'll need to buy at least a Raspberry Pi microcontroller, plus pay for the fabrication of at least one printed circuit board. In all, I would expect a total cost on the order of $100. If this is a financial hardship for you, please DM/email/whatever me; I'll find a way to get you what you need. Nobody should find a way to pay $70,000 for Tufts, and then be held back because they're short $50.
